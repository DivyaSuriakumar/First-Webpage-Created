                Programming
            </h2>
            <p>
                Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. Programming 
                can be done using a variety of computer programming languages, such as JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and C++.Programming 
                involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the 
                implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding).he source code of a program 
                is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed 
                by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance 
                of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming 
                thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, 
                and formal logic.

            <h2>C Programming</h2>
            <p>
                C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, 
                with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. It has found lasting 
                use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software 
                for computer architectures that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

            <h2>Java Programming</h2>
            <P>
                Java is a High Level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as 
                possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning 
                that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically 
                compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of 
                Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.

            <h2>JavaScript Programming</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, 
                often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and 
                first-class functions.Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites 
                use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript 
                engine to execute the code on the user's device.
